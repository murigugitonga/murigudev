                   Charles has been a good friend over the years. I worked with
                   him in university where we first started learning programming in general.
                   He excelled at coming up with solutions where none seemed to exist.

                    I was paired with charles when he entered the software development department 
                    during his internship. What was striking about him as an intern was that he never saw 
                    bugs as challenges, rather, he embraced them as part of his learning journey. Not once did 
                    I see him cower when solving bugs. He is always learning.
